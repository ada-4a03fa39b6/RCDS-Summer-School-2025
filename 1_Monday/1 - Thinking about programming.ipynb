    "## What have you learned before this summer school\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you have completed the Coursera course \"Introduction to Python for Researchers\" by Chris Cooling. We'll build on this content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course has been carefully designed to give you skills that most researchers need. For example, the course uses the VS Code environment, which is considered a good choice for a research project development, and introduces good software engineering practices, such as the concept of testing from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you should be familiar with most types of variables, their scope and have an idea how different types are stored in computer memory. You know how to test various conditions with Boolean operators and how to write an if statement. You have been introduced to variable types that can hold multiple values at the same time, such as strings and lists. You know how to iterate through these collections and have practised how to manipulate them.\n",
    "Early on, you also learned about writing your own functions that enable you to make your code modular and to reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises (especially the final one) allowed you to practise these concepts and also, importantly, made you think about how to design and structure a bit more complicated problem. You may have noticed that this is almost a separate skill. When you are relatively comfortable with Python syntax, you will find that the clean and efficient design of your code will gradually become the focus. This said, it may be a good idea to pause and think about programming in general.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, before we dive into Python syntax, let's think about what it means to program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone has a different problem that they would like to address. Regardless of the problem, you all need to decompose the problem into smaller, manageable steps (similarly to giving someone directions). When you design the steps, you have to keep in mind how they would map them onto available \"tools\" that a programming language offers. When you are facing a large programming project, \"modularity\" comes into play. Broadly speaking, it is about deciding how to meaningfully divide your solution into parts (or modules) so that the code can be reused and built on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have the opportunity to tackle various problems this week, and I encourage you to view this course as a programmatic or computational thinking course that happens to be taught in Python, rather than just a Python course."

    "Lines of programming code are referred to as **statements** - a unit of code that has an effect, for example, calculating a value and assigning it to a variable ```a = b + 2```. Within statements, one can find **expressions**, for example, the addition of two numbers ```b + 2```. Expressions can contain values ```2``` and variables ```b``` and **operators** ```+```. Allowed operators depend on the type of the value or variable. For example, numeric operators include addition.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is safe to say that most programming languages are designed using the same conceptual building blocks. Of course, syntax and details may vary, but the basic idea stays the same. This is good news! Once you have learned to program with one language, the others will become easier. Your focus will shift to the particular advantages and packages that each language offers instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language has advantages and disadvantages. Each has a traditional community and tooling around it. For example, at Imperial, you'll find R users predominantly in Biological Sciences. However, it may not be well known that there is an R community in the Department of Mathematics and the Business School. It is not that surprising when you realise that R is a statistical language at the core.\n",

When a program runs, each variable has to be stored in memory (RAM). The fine details of this may vary in different languages, and it is a good idea to know how. For example, knowing the way a matrix is implemented will enable you to speed up your code by accessing the elements of the matrix in the right order. Efficient memory use is at the heart of many optimisation techniques. You may think you are a long way away from having to do something like this...
